  Show that under Hamiltonian evolution,
  $
    pdv(, t) rho = (- i)/hbar [hat(H), rho]
  $
  the purity $Tr(rho^2)$ is a constant of the motion.

  + Consider a pure ensemble of identically prepared spin $1/2$ systems. Suppose the expectation values $expval(S_x)$ and $expval(S_z)$ and the sign of $expval(S_y)$ are known. Show how we may determine the state vector. Why is it unnecessary to know the magnitude of $expval(S_y)$?
  + Consider a mixed ensemble of spin $1/2$ systems. Suppose the ensemble averages $expval(expval(S_x))$, $expval(expval(S_y))$, and $expval(expval(S_z))$ are all known. Show how we may construct the $2 times 2$ density matrix that characterizes the ensemble.
